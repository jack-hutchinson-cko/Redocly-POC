# Environment

The SDK will target an environment based on the **useSandbox** value you provide when you initialize it:


**Sandbox** (_true_): https://api.sandbox.checkout.com

**Live** (_false_): https://api.checkout.com

<Information type="note">
    Public and secret key pairs will only work for their relevant environment. Sandbox keys begin with "pk&#95;test&#95;" or "sk&#95;test&#95;". You will receive separate Live keys for use in your production environment when going live with Checkout.com.
</Information>


## Testing

If you are testing in the Sandbox environment, Checkout.com provides a list of <Link to="https://docs.checkout.com/testing/test-card-numbers">test card details</Link> You can also simulate a lot of edge cases like Declines, by using [special transaction values](https://docs.checkout.com/testing/response-code-testing).

<Information type="information">
    You can also test 3D Secure with the test cards provided. If you want to test 3DS 2 flows, use the cards mentioned <a href="https://docs.checkout.com/testing/3d-secure-testing" target="_blank">here</a>
