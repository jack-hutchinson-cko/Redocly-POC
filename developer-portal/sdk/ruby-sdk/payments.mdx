# Payments

You can find a list of request body parameters and possible outcomes <Link to="https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments">here</Link>.

## Using boolean/falsy values

"nil" or empty strings will be stripped from API calls

```ruby
# ignored
payment_request_source.capture = nil
payment_request_source.capture = ""
```

but "false" or 0 are retained and sent in the request

```ruby
# sent
payment_request_source.capture = false
payment_request_source.capture = 0
```

See [api_resource_spec](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-sdk-ruby/blob/master/spec/checkout_sdk/api_resource_spec.rb#L10-L24) for details.

## Request a card payment with a card token

The card token is generated by front-end integration options such as <Link to="https://docs.checkout.com/docs/frames">Frames</Link> or one of the <Link to="https://docs.checkout.com/docs/sdks#section-mobile-sdk-libraries">Mobile SDKs</Link>. Keep in mind that this token expires in 15 minutes and can only be used once.

```ruby
payment_request_source = CheckoutSdk::PaymentRequestSource.new
payment_request_source.type = "token"
payment_request_source.token = "tok_ubfj2q76miwundwlk72vxt2i7q"
payment_request_source.amount = 1000
payment_request_source.currency = "GBP"
payment_request_source.reference = "ORD-090857"

# Send API call
response = api_resource.request_payment(payment_request_source)

# response parsing
puts(response.data) # => {...}
puts(response.body) # => "..."
```

## Request a card payment with a full card details

<Information type="warning">
	You need to have a high level of PCI Compliance (SAQ-D) to be able to send requests with full card details. Note that
	unless this payment option is enabled on your account by Checkout.com, the request will fail. Contact you account
	manager to request access for this payment interaction.
</Information>

```ruby
payment_request_source = CheckoutSdk::PaymentRequestSource.new
payment_request_source.type = "card"
payment_request_source.card_number = "4242424242424242"
payment_request_source.card_expiry_month = 6
payment_request_source.card_expiry_year = 2025
payment_request_source.card_name = "Bruce Wayne"
payment_request_source.card_cvv = "100"
payment_request_source.amount = 1000
payment_request_source.currency = "GBP"

# Send API call
response = api_resource.request_payment(payment_request_source)

# response parsing
puts(response.data) # => {...}
puts(response.body) # => "..."
```

## Request a card payment with an existing card

After you perform at least one successful payment for a customer, Checkout.com will return a source.id. This id does not expire, so it can be used to perform subsequent payments without needing the customer to enter the card details again.

```ruby
payment_request_source = CheckoutSdk::PaymentRequestSource.new
payment_request_source.type = "id"
payment_request_source.token = "src_vg3tm54ndfbefotjlmgrrvbxli"
payment_request_source.amount = 1000
payment_request_source.currency = "GBP"

# Send API call
response = api_resource.request_payment(payment_request_source)

# response parsing
puts(response.data) # => {...}
puts(response.body) # => "..."
```

## Request a 3D Secure payment

You have the ability to authenticate with 3DS in a payment request. The request body is similar to normal card payments, but with some additional parameters. <Link to="https://docs.checkout.com/docs/3d-secure-payments">Read more about 3DS</Link>.

```ruby
payment_request_source = CheckoutSdk::PaymentRequestSource.new
payment_request_source.type = "token"
payment_request_source.token = "tok_ubfj2q76miwundwlk72vxt2i7q"
payment_request_source.amount = 1000
payment_request_source.currency = "GBP"
payment_request_source.reference = "ORD-090857"
payment_request_source.threeds_enabled = true

# Send API call
response = api_resource.request_payment(payment_request_source)

# response parsing
puts(response.data) # => {...}
puts(response.body) # => "..."
```

3D Secure payments will return a redirection URL. Here is an example of a 3DS response:

```json
{
	"id": "pay_hehfmlkpykeupofyxf7nbr6yyy",
	"status": "Pending",
	"customer": {
		"id": "cus_u4a4zosnrw7ehhzr7jipbkdzo4"
	},
	"3ds": {
		"downgraded": false,
		"enrolled": "Y"
	},
	"_links": {
		"self": {
			"href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_hehfmlkpykeupofyxf7nbr6yyy"
		},
		"redirect": {
			"href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/v2/3ds/acs/sid_feixbit6us3utfedjulm6egnsu"
		}
	}
}
```

You can access the redirection URL via the SDK like so:

```ruby
redirectURL = response.data._links.redirect.href
```

## Get payment details

```ruby
details = api_resource.get_payment_details("pay_juevt3h5mcjulir2t5g3wfug6u") # or with session id sid_XXX
```

## Get payment actions

```ruby
actions = api_resource.get_payment_actions("pay_juevt3h5mcjulir2t5g3wfug6u")
```

## Capture a payment

```ruby
capture_payment = CheckoutSdk::CapturePayment.new
capture_payment.id = "pay_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44"
capture_payment.amount = "1000"
capture_payment.reference = "your reference"

response = api_resource.capture_payment(capture_payment)
```

## Refund a payment

```ruby
refund_payment = CheckoutSdk::RefundPayment.new
refund_payment.id = "pay_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44"
refund_payment.amount = "1000"
refund_payment.reference = "your reference"

response = api_resource.refund_payment(refund_payment)
```

## Void a payment

```ruby
void_payment = CheckoutSdk::VoidPayment.new
void_payment.id = "pay_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44"
void_payment.reference = "your reference"

response = api_resource.void_payment(void_payment)
```
