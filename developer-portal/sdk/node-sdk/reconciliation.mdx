# Reconciliation

You can find a list of request body parameters and possible outcomes <Link to="https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Reconciliation">here</Link>.

## Get JSON payments report

```js
const reconciliation = await cko.reconciliation.getPayments({
	from: '2019-05-17T16:48:52Z',
	to: '2019-06-17T16:48:52Z',
});
```

## Paginate the payments JSON report

The API response can be paginated, either by you setting the "limit" parameter, or by having more then 500 records in the response.
Here you have an example of how you would handle the pagination:

<Information type="note">
	In case the API response contains a next page, the page identifier will be injected in the response object as "page".
	You can then use that value in a subsequent call to move to the next page. (by using the "after" parameter)
</Information>

```js
let page;

// Iterate until there is no longer a page to go to
do {
	const reconciliation = await cko.reconciliation.getPayments({
		from: '2020-07-07T17:51:42Z',
		to: '2020-07-07T17:51:59Z',
		limit: 10,
		after: page, // in case you saw a page already, skip it
	});
	// the next page you can go to
	page = reconciliation.page;
	console.log(reconciliation);
} while (page);
```

## Get JSON single payment report

```js
const reconciliation = await cko.reconciliation.getPayment('pay_nezg6bx2k22utmk4xm5s2ughxi');

```js
app.get('/getCsv', async (req, res) => {
	const csv = await cko.reconciliation.getPaymentsCsv({
		from: '2019-05-17T16:48:52Z',
		to: '2019-07-17T16:48:52Z',
	});
	res.setHeader('Content-disposition', `attachment; filename=Payments.csv`);
	res.set('Content-Type', 'text/csv');
	res.end(csv, 'binary');
});
```
