# Request a card payment

Once you've successfully set up your integration, you're able to start receiving and tokenizing your customers' card details. After this tokenization process, you're ready to create a payment. To do this, you can use our API and your server-side code.

<Information type="tip">
    Card tokens (<code>tok_</code>) are single use and only have a 15-minute lifespan. Once you've successfully sent your request, you'll receive a response containing a permanent card source ID (<code>src_</code>) which can be used in subsequent payment requests.
