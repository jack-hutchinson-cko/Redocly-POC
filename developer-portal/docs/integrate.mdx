# Integrate

Read about our integration methods below, then choose the one that best suits your needs.

<Information type="tip" header="Update your integration to support SCA">
	As of 14 September 2019, the EU’s revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) requires merchants to apply Strong
	Customer Authentication (SCA) to most online payments within Europe. To comply with these new requirements, merchants
	should adopt the next generation of authentication – 3D Secure 2 (3DS2) – which creates a smoother and more secure
	checkout flow. Our integrations fully support 3DS2 and SCA, and ensure that you only ask your customers for additional
	authentication when needed.

## Frames

Frames is a highly customizable payment form, which allows customers to enter their payment details directly on your checkout page or in your app. We process these and exchange them for a secure, single-use token. You can then use this token to request a payment, without having to process or store any sensitive information yourself.

## Payment Links

The fastest way to accept payments, through any device and channel. Send a payment link to your customer and they'll be taken to a Checkout.com-hosted payment page to complete their purchase.

## Hosted Payments Page

Accept payments through our Hosted Payments Page. We render a payment page where your customer enters their payment details, and in the background we generate a token and complete the payment request.

## SDKs

Whether you're processing payments on desktop or on mobile, our software development kits give you the freedom to build your own custom integration. We'll still take care of the processing side of things, and return tokenized payment information to you.

## E-Commerce

Our payment gateway is integrated with many popular e-commerce platforms. Get up and running quickly, processing online payments with an e-commerce plugin.

## Unified Payments API

<Information type="warning">
	This integration method requires SAQ D PCI compliance. For more information, see{' '}
	<a href="https://docs.checkout.com/risk-management/pci-compliance">PCI compliance</a>.
</Information>
Unlike our other integration methods, the full card details API does not use card tokens. Instead, you process your customers'
card details directly. If you are looking to have total control over the checkout experience, then the full card details
API may be the option for you.
